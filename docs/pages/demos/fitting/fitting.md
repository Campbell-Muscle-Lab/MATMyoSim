## Fitting

In this context, fitting means adjusting model parameters to obtain the best possible fit between the simulations and experimental data.

This can be done by fitting:
+ in the time domain
  + matching simulations and experimental traces plotted against time
+ pCa curves
  + matching simulations and experimental data plotted as a function of activating Ca<sup>concentration</sup>
+ in the frequency domain
  + matching Nyquist plots showing elastic and viscous moduli as a function of frequency

Fitting in MATMyoSim is performed using an [Optimization structure](..\..\structures\optimization_structure\optimization_structure.html)
