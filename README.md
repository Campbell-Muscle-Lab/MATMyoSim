# MATMyoSim

This is a GitHub Repository for a MATLAB-based implementation of MyoSim, software for simulating the mechanical properties of half-sarcomeres using cross-bridge distribution techniques.

To get started:
+ look at the [Documentation pages](http://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/MATMyoSim)
+ run the demos described in the documentation

Please create an issue if (okay, when) you discover bugs or want help adding new features.

Be aware that MyoSim was originally developed in C++ and has also been ported to Python. Different versions of the software are at different stages of development. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.
